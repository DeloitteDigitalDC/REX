# REX Tips - Quickly see the feature set of the application

We realize that not everyone viewing our application will be able to spend time customizing their REX instances, so we have outlined two examples of ways to see features you may have otherwise missed. 

### Recalled drug alerts
If a drug in your cabinet has been recalled, it will be highlighted.  

Example drug with a recall: **Niacin**.

### Pregnancy & Breastfeeding Alerts 

In your user profile, select "Someone in my household is pregnant, breast feeding or may become pregnant." to see pregnancy alerts in drug views.
